# Minion Reference

## Introduction

To use Minion, your makefile must end with the following line:

    include ../minion/minion.mk

The file minion.mk is self-contained; it requires no other file from this
project.  Minion is tested with GNU Make v3.81.

If you invoke make without any arguments, Minion will attempt to build a
target named `default`, which your makefile may define using an *alias*
(described below) or an ordinary Make rule.

If you pass arguments on the command line, Minion will treat the arguments
as a set of goals and build them.  Each goal may be the target of an
ordinary Make rule, or one of the following Minion constructs:

  * A *instance*, such as `CC(foo.c)`
  * An *indirection*, such as `@var` or `CC@var`
  * An *alias*, such as `all` or `clean`.

If you invoke make with `help` as one of the goals, Minion will output a
description of the other goals, rather than build them.

## Target IDs and Lists

In Make, a "target" is part of a rule definition, and it is generally the
name of the file generated by the rule.  Rules do not have to generate
output files, in which case the target name simply serves to identify the
rule.  In that case, `.PHONY: TARGET` should be used to avoid confusing the
target with anactual file.

For rules generated by Minion, the instance names -- e.g. `CC(hello.c)` --
are used to identify them.  We do not use the output file as a means of
identifying Minion rules.

We use the term *target ID* when we mean either an instance name (for Minion
rules), a target name associated with a Make rule defined in your Makefile,
or a source file.

We use the term *target list* when we mean a space-delimited list of target
IDs and/or indirections (which identify target IDs.)


## Instances

A "instance" is an expression that describes a build step, and takes the
form: `CLASS(ARGS)`.

Given this class name and list of arguments, Minion determines the name of
the output file, how it is constructed, and what other files are required to
construct it.  Minion uses this information to generate a rule that will be
processed by Make.  For example, `CC(hello.c)` denotes an object file that
results from compiling `hello.c`.

## Aliases

Aliases are names that may be used on the command line as goals.

If your makefile defines a variable named `Alias(NAME).in` or
`Alias(NAME).command`, then `NAME` is a valid *alias*.  The value of the
`.in` variable, if defined, identifies all the targets that the alias will
cause to be built.  It can contain indirections or target IDs.  The value of
the `.command` variable, if defined, is a shell command to be executed when
the alias is named as a goal.

## Indirections

An "indirection" is a word that names a variable.  Indirections may appear
in [target lists](#target-ids-and-lists) and on the command line.  In these
contexts, an "expansion" step is performed, in which indirections are
replaced with the target IDs they reference.

There are two forms of indirections:

 - `@VAR`      : a simple indirection
 - `CLASS@VAR` : a mapped indirection

A simple indirection expands to the value of the variable `VAR`.  Other
indirections may appear within the value of the variable, in which case they
are recursively processed during expansion.  The result of expansion is zero
or more target IDs (instances or ordinary target names).

A mapped indirection applies the CLASS constructor individually to the
target IDs resulting from the expansion of `@VAR`.  For example, if `@var`
expands to `a.c b.c`, then `CC@var` will expand to `CC(a.c) CC(b.c)`.

Mapped indirections can also use a "chained" syntax.  Using the same example
`var` as above, `C1@C2@var`, would yield `C1(C2(a.c)) C1(C2(b.c))`.

`CLASS` and `VAR` may not contain `(` or `)`, and the indirection must be an
entire word that matches one of the above two forms.  For example,
`CC(@sources)` is a target ID, *not* an indirection, and will not be altered
during the expansion step.  Its argument, on the other hand, *is* an
indirection, and it will be expanded when the `CC(@sources)` instance's
inputs are evaluated.

## Classes

The behavior of an instance is determined by a set of *properties* that are
computed for the instance. Property definitions are stored in Make variables
whose names take the form `CLASS.PROPERTY` or `CLASS(ARGS).PROPERTY`, with
the latter, instance-specific form taking precedence if both are defined.

Each class can inherit definitions from other classes.  This set of classes
is listed in a variable named `CLASS.inherit`.  When Minion computes a
property, and there is no definition for that property associated with its
instance name or its class name, Minion will search the inherited classes,
in order, for the first matching definition.  These inherited classes can,
in turn, inherit from other classes.

The values associated with definitions can, as with ordinary Make variables,
use `$(...)` to substitute Make variables and call functions.  However, they
may not use `${...}`, because `{` and `}` are reserved for Minion-specific
functionality.  Expressions of the form `{...}` expand to the value of the
property named by `...`.  The string `{inherit}` expands to the inherited
value of the property -- the value it *would have* taken on if the current
definition had not been present.  To include an actual `{` or `}` character,
use `$([[)` or `$(]])`.

While a property definition is being expanded, various [functions and
variables exported by Minion](#exported-definitions) are available for use.
These can be used directly within a property definition, or within a
function or variable that is referenced by a property definition.

Minion property evaluation is memoized, so each property definition is
expanded no more than once for each instance.

Note that instances have no associated "state".  All property definitions
are purely functional in nature.  As such, there is no notion of "creating"
or "destroying" instances.  We cannot say whether an instance "exists" or
not ... but we can talk about whether it is *mentioned* or not.  Think of a
class as a function -- somewhat elaborate and multifacted, but ultimately a
function that yields a set of property definitions.  An instance identifies
the function (class) and its inputs (argument list).

### "Simple" Definitions

Make supports two "flavors" of variables, "simple" (using `:=`) and
"recursive" (using `=`).  The above discussion assumes that properties are
defined using recursive (`=`) assignments.  Properties *may* be defined
using simple assignments.  With `:=`, values are expanded when and where the
assignment appears (prior to inclusion of `minion.mk`), so they may not make
use of `{...}` syntax or Minion exported functions and variables.


## Cached Rules

Ordinarily, every time you invoke `make`, Minion computes the `rule`
property for all goals and their transitive dependencies prior to Make's
rule processing phase.  If your makefile describes hundreds or thousands of
build steps, this can take a perceptible amount of time.  To accelerate
incremental builds, Minion can write many or all of its generated rules to a
"cache" file, and avoid re-computing them every time `make` is invoked.

To enable caching, assign to the variable `minion_cache` a [target
list](#target-ids-and-lists) that identifies the target IDs to be cached.
All of the rules of the referenced instances and their transitive
dependencies will be written to a cache file.

When using `minion_cache`, you can still build either cached or uncached
goals.  Minion will use cached rules when they are present, and dynamically
generate any other required rules.

The cache file will be re-generated whenever your makefile changes, so
generally the results of building with cached rules will be the same as when
you build without cached rules.  However, if the commands in your build
steps depend on the dynamic state of the system, then the cached rules will
reflect those values as of the time when the cache file was generated, which
may differ from what those values are when you invoke make.

One such scenario occurs when you override variables on the Make command
line in order to perform a one-off customized build.  When doing so, you can
also set `minion_cache` to the empty string to perform that build without
caching, avoiding any problems with stale cached rules.  For example:

    $ make CC.optFlags=-Ot minion_cache=

Another such scenario occurs when you have instances whose commands or
inputs may vary according to information pulled from the system via, for
example, `$(wildcard ...)` or `$(shell ...)`.  When this is the case, you
can list those specific instances in the variable `minion_cache_exclude`, so
that their rules will be excluded from the cache file and instead be
generated each time you invoke make.  For example:

    ...
    minion_cache = Alias(default)
    minion_cache_exclude = LinkC(@prog)
    ...
    prog = $(wildcard *.c)
    ...

Note that whereas `minion_cache` implicitly includes all transitive
dependencies of the listed target IDs, `minion_cache_exclude` does not.  It
is intended to target individual build steps.


## Builders

All instances being built must implement this interface.  It consists of
just three properties:

 * `rule` : a string of Make source code, that, when eval'ed, will define a
   Make rule for the instance.

 * `out`: the resulting file path, or phony target name.

 * `needs`: a list of target IDs that are prerequisites of `rule`.

User-defined classes do not need to implement these directly.  Instead, they
should inherit from `Builder`.

## Builder

`Builder` is a built-in class that implements the builder interface and
handles a number of low-level responsibilities, including the following:

 * An output file name and location is computed.  (See [Outputs](#outputs),
   below).

 * Inputs are obtained from the unnamed arguments.

 * The build command is escaped for Make syntax to avoid unintended
   evaluation, and the output file's directory is created prior to execution
   of the command.

 * After changes to makefiles affect the way artifacts are built, the
   affected artifacts (and only those) will be rebuilt.  See (validity
   values)[#validity-values].

Subclasses can leverage this functionality by inheriting from Builder, and
can then customize their functionality by defining or overriding properties.

### `{command}`

Subclasses of Builder must provide a definition for the `command` property.
Builder will provide defaults for all other properties.  The value is one or
more shell commands separated by newline characters.  Its definition may
make use of the following property references:

 * `{@}`: the output file
 * `{<}`: the first input file
 * `{^}`: all input files

These properties correspond to Make's "automatic variables" `$@`, `$<`, and
`$^`, which are unavailable in Minion property definitions, since command
expansion happens prior to the rule processing phase.  The value of `{^}` is
not identical to Make's `$^`, but it is more often what you want: it is a
list of the *input* files, which are derived from the target IDs given by
the `in` property.  On the other hand, make's `$^` includes all
prerequisites, which may include tools, implied dependencies, and other
files that would not normally appear as command line arguments.

For example, the `Tar` class inherits this definition of `command`:

    _Tar.command = tar -cvf {@} {^}

### `{outExt}`

Most subclasses of `Builder` will define `{outExt}`, which specifies the
extension (including the ".") that the output file will have.  A `%`
character in `{outExt}` represents the extension of the input file.
Builder.outExt is defined as `%`, so by default output files will have the
same extension as the input file.

For example:

    _Tar.outExt = .tar

### `{in}` and `{out}`

Typically, an instance can be thought of as a function that accepts one or
more input files and generates one output file, but there are exceptions to
this rule.  In those cases, the class may override `{in}` and/or `{out}`.

The value of `in` is a [target list](#target-ids-and-lists).

The value of `out` is a file name.

The `Mkdir` class has no inputs, and uses its first argument to specify the
output.  It inherits from `_Mkdir`:

    _Mkdir.in =
    _Mkdir.out = $(_arg1)

The `Copy` class exists to deploy files to a specific, well-known location,
rather than an automatically-generated unique location, so it allows the
output file location to be specified by an argument with the name `out`:

    _Copy.out = $(or $(call _namedArg1,out),{inherit})

For example, `Copy(CC(foo.c),out=deploy/foo.o)` will place its result in
"deploy/foo.o".

### `{up}`

An instance may make use of files that are not specified by the user via
arguments or the `in` property, and instead are built into the definition of
the class.  An example is when a build step uses a tool that is itself a
build product.  We would prefer the dependency on the tool to be "baked
into" the class definition, so when using the class one needs to name only
the files that will be processed by the tool.  This is akin to the notion of
captured values in lexically scoped programming languages.  These built-in
dependencies are stored in the `up` property, which is treated as a [target
list](#target-ids-and-lists).  The specific file names obtained from the
`up` targets are available as properties `up^` and `up<`, analogous to `^`
and `<`.  Note that `^` & `<` do not contain the files in `up^` & `up<`.

### `{oo}`

Order-only dependencies can be specified by defining the `oo` property (a
[target list](#target-ids-and-lists)).  This type of dependency can be
appropriate when there is a dependency on the existence of a file, not on
the content of the file.  It is also useful when there are *implied
dependencies* that may include files generated by the same build.

Implied dependencies are files that are not specified on the command line,
but read during execution of the build command.  The classic example is
files included by C sources using `#include`.  In Make, this is typically
handled with the following strategy:

 a) The command that compiles the C file also generates a dependency file
    expressing dependencies of the output file on the files that were
    included.

 b) The makefile uses `-include` to include a previously generaterd
    dependency file, if one exists.

The dependency file describes the implied dependencies of the
previously-generated object file.  Along with the explicit dependencies, it
accurately describes when the object file becomes stale.  What it does *not*
tell us is what new object file (yet to be built) will depend upon, so there
is a risk that a compilation will begin before a header file generation (or
concurrently with one!) and as a result fail to find a header that will soon
exist, or find the wrong header, or include a stale version of it.  We can
solve this by declaring object files to have order-only dependencies on the
entire set of generated headers.


## Argument Lists

Argument lists may contain multiple comma-delimited values, each with an
optional `NAME:` prefix.

Rule inference is performed on input files.  For example, inference allows a
".c" file to be supplied where a ".o" file is expected, as in
`LinkC(hello.c)`.  Each class can define its own inference rules by
overriding the `inferClasses` property.  It consists of a list of entries of
the form `CLASS.EXT`, each indicating that `CLASS` should be applied to a
input file ending in `.EXT`.


## Outputs

An instance's output file location is given by the value of its `out`
property.  Builder provides a definition of `out` that is designed to avoid
conflicts between instances, by ensuring that different instance names
always generate different output file paths.  Its `out` property is composed
of `outDir` and `outName` properties.

    Builder.out = {outDir}{outName}
    Builder.outName = $(call _applyExt,$(notdir {outBasis}),{outExt})
    Builder.outExt = %

The output directory is underneath `$(OUTDIR)`, which defaults to `.out/`
and may be overridden by user makefiles.

Derived classes typically override just the `outExt` property, which is used
in constructing the output file name.  Within `outExt`, `%` represents the
input file extension.

The `nameBasis` property is based on the first unnamed argument.  It is the
name of the file it denotes, except in the case of an indirection, when the
variable name is used.  For example:

    Instance name     `nameBasis`
    --------------    -------------------------------
    Class(FILE)       FILE
    Class(C(A))       $(call get,out,C(A))
    Class(@VAR)       VAR
    Class(C@VAR)      VAR

### Validity Values

By default, the *command* used to build a target is treated as a dependency
of the target.  That is, if any changes to makefiles result in changes to
the build command, previous outputs (built by different commands) are
considered stale, so they will be rebuilt the next time they are freshened
with `make`.

This is controlled by the `vvFile` property, which identifies a file that
holds the value of the previous command.  If the value of `vvFile` is empty,
this validity check is disabled.  Phony targets disable this feature because
they are always treated as stale.  User makefiles can disable this on a
per-instance or per-class basis by setting `vvFile` to the empty string, and
may disable it globally by setting `Builder.vvFile` to the empty string.

### Overriding `out`, `outDir`, or `outName`

When using Minion, we generally don't care where intermediate output files
are located, since we refer to them by their instance names.  When dealing
with the final build results, we can place them in a specific location or
define instances that deploy them to a specific location.  The `Copy` class
can be used for this, or we override the `out` or `outDir` properties or
instances or subclasses.

Also, we may want to override `outName` on an instance-specific basis if we
find the default inconvenient.

Be aware of the following implications:

 1. Minion's `make clean` simply executes `rm -rf $(OUTDIR)`.  It will not
    remove any output files that are placed outside of `$(OUTDIR)`.

 2. If two instances have the same `out` property, a Make error will result.
    If a class overrides `outName` in a way that does not include `outBase`,
    then Builder's definition of `outDir` will not ensure that conflicts are
    avoided.

### Output Directories

An architectural pillar of Minion is that, generally, intermediate output
file locations should not matter.  However, we do try to generate readable
and navigable output directories for the sake of those rare cases where a
user directly encounters them.


## Example

Assume a Makefile contains the following:


    Alias(default).in = @results
    Alias(deploy).in = Deploy(@results)

    results = LinkC(@objects)
    objects = baz.o CC@sources
    sources = foo.c bar.c

    include minion.mk

Typing `make` or `make default` will build `@results`, and typing `make
deploy` will build `Deploy(@results)`.

There is a single `LinkC` instance, and its argument is `@objects`.  The
program's `in` property defaults to its unnamed arguments:

    LinkC(@objects).in --> "@objects"

The `inIDs` property gives the result of expanding indirections:

    LinkC(@objects).inIDs
       --> "baz.o CC(foo.c) CC(bar.c)"

The `prereqs` property resolves these target IDs to their corresponding
target names:

    LinkC(@objects).prereqs
       --> "baz.o .out/CC.c/foo.o .out/CC.c/bar.o"

## Exported Definitions

Minion defines a number of variables and functions for use by user Makefiles
within recursive property definitions.

* Character constants

  - `$(\n)`: newline
  - `$(\t)`: tab
  - `$(\s)`: space
  - `$;` : `,`
  - `$[` : `(`
  - `$]` : `)`
  - `$([[)`: `{`
  - `$(]])`: `}`
  - `$(\H)`: `#`

* `$(call get,PROP,IDS)`

  Evaluate property PROP for each member of IDS.  IDS is a space-delimited
  list of target IDs.  The result is a space-delimited list of the
  corresponding values.

  "Plain" target IDs -- those that are not instance names -- identify either
  source files or the target of a Make rule defined in your Makefile.  The
  properties a plain target ID are defined as the properties of an instance
  named `File(ID)`.  The `File` class supplies definitions for the `out`,
  `rule`, and `needs` properties.  For example, `$(call get,out,name)` is
  equivalent to `$(call get,out,File(name))`, and it results in `name`.

* `$(call .,PROP,$0)`

  Evaluate property PROP for the current instance.  In property definitions,
  `$(call .,PROP,$0)` is equivalent to `{PROP}`.  In other variables and
  functions, `{...}` syntax is not supported, but `.` is available if they
  are called during the evaluation of a property definition.  It is
  recommended to pass `$0` as the second argument, which is used only to
  construct a diagnostic message in the event PROP is undefined.

* `$(call _shellQuote,STR)`

  Quote STR as an argument for /bin/sh or /bin/bash.

* `$(call _printfEsc,STR)`

  Escape STR for inclusion in a `printf` format string on a command line.

* `$(call _printf,STR)`

  Return a shell command that writes STR to stdout.

* `$(call _eq,A,B)`

  Return "1" if A and B are equal, "" otherwise.

* `$(call _once,VAR)`

  Return the value of VAR, evaluating it at most once.

* `$(_self)`

  Return the name of the current instance.

* `$(_class)`

  Return the class of the current instance.

* `$(_argText)`

  Return the portion of the current instance name that describes the
  argument list.

  For example, in `Class(a,b,x:1,x:2)`, `$(_argText)` returns "a,b,x:1,x:2".

* `$(_args)`

  Return all unnamed arguments for the current instance.

  For example, in `Class(a,b,x:1,x:2)`, `$(_args)` returns "a b".

* `$(_arg1)`

  Same as `$(word 1,$(_args))`.

* `$(call _namedArgs,NAME)`

  Return all arguments associated with NAME for the current instance.

  For example, in `Class(a,b,x:1,x:2)`, `$(call _namedArgs,x)` returns "1 2".

* `$(call _namedArg1,NAME)`

  Same as `$(word 1,$(call _namedArgs,NAME))`.


## Syntax

A target ID is either a `Name` (identifying a source file or target of a
Make rule) or an `Instance`.

Names avoids characters that are interpreted by POSIX shells or GNU Make as
special, except for `~`, which is interpreted similarly by both.  As a
result, there should be no need for special quoting or escaping of file
names in commands.

The following BNF summarizes:

    Name     := NameChar+
    Instance := Class '(' ArgList ')'
    Class    := ClassChar+
    ArgList  := ( Arg ( ',' Arg )* )?
    Arg      := ( Name `:` )? Value
    Value    := ( Instance | Name | Property )+
    Property := PropChar+

These definitions rely on the following character classes:

    ClassChar:  A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - + / ^ ~ { }
    NameChar:   A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - + / ^ ~ { } .
    PropChar:   A-Z a-z 0-9 _ - + / ^ ~       @ < >

Note that argument list contains zero or more arguments, and each argument
must contain at least one character.  Arguments may contain other instances
embedded within them, which means they can contain `(` and `)`, characters,
but only in balanced pairs, as well as `,` and `:`, but only within nested
parentheses.

In general, instances will contain special shell characters, so they may
have to be quoted when being passed on the command line.
