# Notes

## Todo

* Handle '$...' targets during $(end), and make $... rule a no-op.

* Incorporate $A more completely in Program[]
  fssafe: encode [ ] , = : /

* Exec[a=X,FILE,a=Y]
   - incorporate $A

* Rewrites

  Print.inherit = Rewrite ;  Print.rewrite = Exec[w=cat,$A]

  Rewrite.out = $(call get,out,$(call .,rewrite))
  Rewrite.needs = $(call .,rewrite)
  Rewrite.rule = #

* Goal.X  -->  make_X

* make C[A].P

  Should this echo (like, `make help C[A].P`, but without decoration)?
  Or should this write the value to a file?  Print[C[A].P] would echo.
